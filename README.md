## ImageSearch

#FreeCodeCamp API: Image Search Abstraction Layer

For FCC

I am using https://www.npmjs.com/package/bing.search here 
and i am trying Jade for the first time as i have repeated the same html for the last few times.. as this api needs only few line of html i think its a good way to learn jade


###To set env variables:

LOCAL -- export BING_SEARCH_KEY="Go to https://datamarket.azure.com/account/keys"
HEROKU -- heroku config:set BING_SEARCH_KEY="Go to https://datamarket.azure.com/account/keys"
